# Seaborn_Palettes


This repository includes code that can help visualize each of seaborn's palettes in a practical way using a bar graph.

The data is generated from 100 random numbers that range from 0 to 10.

There is an option to copy the code for your own use. I have separated it so it can be viewed in one column, in two columns, or -as it is seen- in four columns to reduce the amount of scrolling.

There is also a short visual that reviews how to reverse the order of the colors using "_r" at the end of any palette name.
